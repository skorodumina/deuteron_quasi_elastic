This is an event generator for quasi-elastic scattering off deuteron (QUEEG). See more details in CLAS12-Note-2014-007 (https://misportal.jlab.org/mis/physics/clas12/viewFile.cfm/2014-007.pdf?documentId=15). The note is located in this folder. 

The source code is in WHATEVER/qeDsim/src
To make it, one should firstly do "setenv TOP_DIR WHATEVER/qeDsim/" 
An executable goes to WHATEVER/qeDsim/bin
The executable runs from the command line. For options see CLAS12-Note-2014-007.

This version was slightly modified comparing with the initial one in order:

- to force it to compile
- to add an option of producing a BOS ouput.
