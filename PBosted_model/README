This is P. Bosted model for the (quasi)-elastic and inclusive scattering off free proton, deuteron, and some other nuclei. The initial code is taken from https://userweb.jlab.org/~bosted/fits.html . See also more deteils at https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.0159v4.pdf

The code was initially on FORTRANT, however it is wrapped in C++. See Main.cc for calling the FORTRAN fuctions, which are called through the F1F209Wrapper.cc.

Upon compiling the library libF1F209.so is created.

Two more fortran subroutins were added to the inital set by me. See more details in the top of F1F209.f
